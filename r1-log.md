### R1D1 
Started an [Address Book](https://github.com/wowsuchnamaste/address_book) app
using TDD. Started this challenge.

Continued with the [Address Book](https://github.com/wowsuchnamaste/address_book)
app. More tests and more useful implementation.

### R1D3
Continued with the [Address Book](https://github.com/wowsuchnamaste/address_book)
app. It can now store and list entries of people.

### R1D4
Refactored the [Address Book](https://github.com/wowsuchnamaste/address_book).
It now contains less lines of code, and less silly features.

[Address Book](https://github.com/wowsuchnamaste/address_book).

Started work on a command line interface for the
[Address Book](https://github.com/wowsuchnamaste/address_book).
Refactored parts of the code, added mock test.

### R1D7
Added more features to the Address Book CLI. Then learned about Python module
packaging, packaged my training tracker, and initialized a new Django project
with the training tracker package installed. To be continued...
